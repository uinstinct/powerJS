###### Note

Open 15 locally. LocalStorage might not be possible on codepen
Server is required for 19, 20
*I __recommend__ you to open these links in a __desktop__ or laptop and not a mobile device.*

## Local Setup

Although the entire collection can be found on [codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/XWdjWw), you may still want to *try it* on your local machine or *take it for development purposes.*

#### Software Requirements
- Browser *any* (Actually, that's all for most of it!)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- *Any* Preferred Editor

#### Command Run Through

Once you have *the above* requirements installed, you may now:

- Open the folder where you want this collection.
- Open your __terminal__ in *this folder*
- Now type or *just copy the below*
```
git clone https://github.com/uinstinct/powerJS.git
cd powerJS
code .
```

**Note** - *Please change `code .` to your preferred editor*

#### Server Requirement Setup

There are some projects like [CamBooth](/30) which require a server for secure origin.
*(You cannot simply allow webcam to run on file)*

For this, I suggest you to install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) which is an [npm](https://npmjs.com) package for serving local files.
You can do this simply by opening up your *__terminal__* and running :
`npm install -g serve`

In the project, where *a server is required*, just run `serve` in your *__terminal__*.

By default, the page will be served on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
